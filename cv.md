## About Me

Currently I work in Schneider Electric's Budapest Office as Advannced Calculation Tool Architecture Specialist. I decided to switch my career direction since I was interested in creating rather than using various platforms. I don't know if Frontend Development will be my final destination, but I am sure I will give it all to go as far as possible.
